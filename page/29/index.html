<p></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p></p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://gafferongames.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glenn Fiedler</a> and welcome to <a href="https://gafferongames.com/categories/game-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Networking for Game Programmers</strong></a>.</p><br><p>Have you ever wondered how multiplayer games work?</p><br><p>From the outside it seems magical: two or more players sharing a consistent experience across the network like they actually exist together in the same virtual world.</p><br><p>But as programmers we know the truth of what is actually going on underneath is quite different from what you see. It turns out it&rsquo;s all an illusion. A massive sleight-of-hand. What you perceive as a shared reality is only an approximation unique to your own point of view and place in time.</p><br><h2 id="peer-to-peer-lockstep">Peer-to-Peer Lockstep</h2><br><p>In the beginning games were networked peer-to-peer, with each each computer exchanging information with each other in a fully connected mesh topology. You can still see this model alive today in RTS games, and interestingly for some reason, perhaps because it was the first way - it&rsquo;s still how most people think that game networking works.</p><br><p>The basic idea is to abstract the game into a series of turns and a set of command messages when processed at the beginning of each turn direct the evolution of the game state. For example: move unit, attack unit, construct building. All that is needed to network this is to run exactly the same set of commands and turns on each player&rsquo;s machine starting from a common initial state.</p><br><p>Of course this is an overly simplistic explanation and glosses over many subtle points, but it gets across the basic idea of how networking for RTS games work. You can read more about this networking model here: <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3094/1500_archers_on_a_288_network_.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1500 Archers on a 28.8: Network Programming in Age of Empires and Beyond</a>.</p><br><p>It seems so simple and elegant, but unfortunately there are several limitations.</p><br><p>First, it&rsquo;s exceptionally difficult to ensure that a game is completely deterministic; that each turn plays out identically on each machine. For example, one unit could take slightly a different path on two machines, arriving sooner to a battle and saving the day on one machine, while arriving later on the other and erm. not saving the day. Like a butterfly flapping it&rsquo;s wings and causing a hurricane on the other side of the world, one <i>tiny difference</i> results in complete desynchronization over time.</p><br><p>The next limitation is that in order to ensure that the game plays out identically on all machines it is necessary to wait until all player&rsquo;s commands for that turn are received <i>before</i> simulating that turn. This means that each player in the game has latency equal to the most lagged player. RTS games typically hide this by providing audio feedback immediately and/or playing cosmetic animation, but ultimately any truly game affecting action may occur only after this delay has passed.</p><br><p>The final limitation occurs because of the way the game synchronizes by sending just the command messages which change the state. In order for this to work it is necessary for all players to start from the same initial state. Typically this means that each player must join up in a lobby before commencing play, although it is technically possible to support late join, this is not common due to the difficulty of capturing and transmitting a completely deterministic starting point in the middle of a live game.</p><br><p>Despite these limitations this model naturally suits RTS games and it still lives on today in games like &ldquo;Command and Conquer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Age of Empires&rdquo; and &ldquo;Starcraft&rdquo;. The reason being that in RTS games the game state consists of many thousands of units and is simply too large to exchange between players. These games have no choice but to exchange the commands which drive the evolution of the game state.</p><br><p>But for other genres, the state of the art has moved on. So that&rsquo;s it for the deterministic peer-to-peer lockstep networking model. Now lets look at the evolution of action games starting with Doom, Quake and Unreal.</p><br><h2 id="client-server">Client/Server</h2><br><p>In the era of action games, the limitations of peer-to-peer lockstep became apparent in Doom, which despite playing well over the LAN played <i>terribly</i> over the internet for typical users:</p><br><blockquote>Although it is possible to connect two DOOM machines together across the Internet using a modem link, the resulting game will be slow, ranging from the unplayable (e.g. a 14.4Kbps PPP connection) to the marginally playable (e.g. a 28.8Kbps modem running a Compressed SLIP driver). Since these sorts of connections are of only marginal utility, this document will focus only on direct net connections.</blockquote><br><p>The problem of course was that Doom was designed for networking over LAN only, and used the peer-to-peer lockstep model described previously for RTS games. Each turn player inputs (key presses etc.) were exchanged with other peers, and before any player could simulate a frame all other player&rsquo;s key presses needed to be received.</p><br><p>In other words, before you could turn, move or shoot you had to wait for the inputs from the most lagged modem player. Just imagine the wailing and gnashing of teeth that this would have resulted in for the sort of folks with internet connections that were &ldquo;of only marginal utility&rdquo;. :)</p><br><p>In order to move beyond the LAN and the well connected elite at university networks and large companies, it was necessary to change the model. And in 1996, that&rsquo;s exactly what John Carmack and his team did when he released Quake using client/server instead of peer-to-peer.</p><br><p>Now instead of each player running the same game code and communicating directly with each other, each player was now a &ldquo;client&rdquo; and they all communicated with just one computer called the &ldquo;server&rdquo;. There was no longer any need for the game to be deterministic across all machines, because the game really only existed on the server. Each client effectively acted as a <i>dumb terminal</i> showing an approximation of the game as it played out on the server.</p><br><p>In a pure client/server model you run no game code locally, instead sending your inputs such as key presses, mouse movement, clicks to the server. In response the server updates the state of your character in the world and replies with a packet containing the state of your character and other players near you. All the client has to do is interpolate between these updates to provide the illusion of smooth movement and <em>BAM</em> you have a networked game.</p><br><p>This was a great step forward. The quality of the game experience now depended on the connection between the client and the server instead of the most lagged peer in the game. It also became possible for players to come and go in the middle of the game, and the number of players increased as client/server reduced the bandwidth required on average per-player.</p><br><p>But there were still problems with the pure client/server model:</p><br><blockquote>While I can remember and justify all of my decisions about networking from DOOM through Quake, the bottom line is that I was working with the wrong basic assumptions for doing a good internet game. My original design was targeted at &lt; 200ms connection latencies. People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience. Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP. This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum. Client. User&#39;s modem. ISP&#39;s modem. Server. ISP&#39;s modem. User&#39;s modem. Client. God, that sucks.<br>Ok, I made a bad call. I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn&#39;t familliar with PPP life. I&#39;m addressing it now.</blockquote><br><p>The problem was of course latency.</p><br><p>What happened next would change the industry forever.</p><br><h2 id="client-side-prediction">Client-Side Prediction</h2><br><p>In the original Quake you felt the latency between your computer and the server. Press forward and you&rsquo;d wait however long it took for packets to travel to the server and back to you before you&rsquo;d actually start moving. Press fire and you wait for that same delay before shooting.</p><br><p>If you&rsquo;ve played any modern FPS like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, you know this is no longer what happens. So how exactly do modern FPS games remove the latency on your own actions in multiplayer?</p><br><p>When writing about his plans for the soon to be released QuakeWorld, John Carmack said:</p><br><blockquote> I am now allowing the client to guess at the results of the users movement until the authoritative response from the server comes through. This is a biiiig architectural change. The client now needs to know about solidity of objects, friction, gravity, etc. I am sad to see the elegant client-as-terminal setup go away, but I am practical above idealistic.</blockquote><br><p>So now in order to remove the latency, the client runs more code than it previously did. It is no longer a dumb terminal sending inputs to the server and interpolating between state sent back. Instead it is able to predict the movement of your character locally and <i>immediately</i> in response to your input, running a subset of the game code for your player character on the client machine.</p><br><p>Now as soon as you press forward, there is no wait for a round trip between client and server - your character start moving forward right away.</p><br><p>The difficulty of this approach is not in the prediction, for the prediction works just as normal game code does - evolving the state of the game character forward in time according to the player&rsquo;s input. The difficulty is in applying the correction back from the server to resolve cases when the client and server disagree about where the player character should be and what it is doing.</p><br><p>Now at this point you might wonder. Hey, if you are running code on the client - why not just make the client authoritative over their player character? The client could run the simulation code for their own character and simply tell the server where they are each time they send a packet. The problem with this is that if each player were able to simply tell the server &ldquo;here is my current position&rdquo; it would be trivially easy to hack the client such that a cheater could instantly dodge the RPG about to hit them, or teleport instantly behind you to shoot you in the back.</p><br><p>So in FPS games it is absolutely necessary that the server is the authoritative over the state of each player character, in-spite of the fact that each player is locally predicting the motion of their own character to hide latency. As Tim Sweeney writes in <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/NetworkingOverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Unreal Networking Architecture</a>: &ldquo;The Server Is The Man&rdquo;.</p><br><p>Here is where it gets interesting. If the client and the server disagree, the client <i>must</i> accept the update for the position from the server, but due to latency between the client and server this correction is necessarily in the past. For example, if it takes 100ms from client to server and 100ms back, then any server correction for the player character position will appear to be 200ms in the past, relative to the time up to which the client has predicted their own movement.</p><br><p>If the client were to simply apply this server correction update verbatim, it would yank the client back in time, completely undoing any client-side prediction. How then to solve this while still allowing the client to predict ahead?</p><br><p>The solution is to keep a circular buffer of past character state and input for the local player on the client, then when the client receives a correction from the server, it first discards any buffered state older than the corrected state from the server, and replays the state starting from the corrected state back to the present &ldquo;predicted&rdquo; time on the client using player inputs stored in the circular buffer. In effect the client invisibly &ldquo;rewinds and replays&rdquo; the last n frames of local player character movement while holding the rest of the world fixed.</p><br><p>This way the player appears to control their own character without any latency, and provided that the client and server character simulation code is reasonable, giving roughly exactly the same result for the same inputs on the client and server, it is rarely corrected. It is as Tim Sweeney describes:</p><br><blockquote>… the best of both worlds: In all cases, the server remains completely authoritative. Nearly all the time, the client movement simulation exactly mirrors the client movement carried out by the server, so the client’s position is seldom corrected. Only in the rare case, such as a player getting hit by a rocket, or bumping into an enemy, will the client’s location need to be corrected.</blockquote><br><p>In other words, only when the player&rsquo;s character is affected by something external to the local player&rsquo;s input, which cannot possibly be predicted on the client, will the player&rsquo;s position need to be corrected. That and of course, if the player is attempting to cheat :)</p>

style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">作为一名程序员，你是否曾想过多人游戏是如何运作的呢？</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">从表面来看这是非常奇妙：两个或者更多的玩家通过网络能够拥有相同的游戏体验，就像他们确实存在于同一个虚拟世界一样。但是作为程序员，我们知道底层运行的情况与你看到的完全不同。事实证明，这完全是一种错觉，是一个精妙的戏法。你能感受到游戏中的玩家都处于同一个世界中，但其实这只是在各个时间点，你自己独有的视角与位置和其他玩家的视角与位置相似。</span></p><p

style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">起初，网络游戏形成一个对等的网络，在这个网络中每台电脑在一个完全连接的网状拓扑结构中互相交换信息。如今在<span>RTS</span>游戏（即时战略游戏）中你仍能够看到这一模型，有趣的是，因为某种原因，可能因为它是第一种网络连接方式——大多数人仍认为游戏网络是这样运作的。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">基本思想就是在处理数据时将游戏抽象化成一系列的数据改变与一组命令消息，每一个数据改变都决定了游戏状态的演变。例如：移动单位、攻击单位、建造建筑。所有的这一切都要求网络让每一位玩家的机器都从相同的初始状态开始，并且运行完全相同的命令，数据的改变也完全相同。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">当然，这只是一个过于简单并且忽略掉了许多微妙细节的解释，但这个解释向我们解释了<span>RTS</span>游戏网络工作的基本原理。你可以点击</span><span><a rel="noopener" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3094/1500_archers_on_a_288_network_.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span>这里</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">了解更多关于这个网络模型的细节。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这看起来是如此简单而又巧妙，但是不幸的是这个模型有几个限制因素。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">首先，要想保证游戏状态完全确定是非常困难的；即每台机器都进行着相同的变动。比如说，一个单位可以在两台机器上走略微不同的道路，在一台机器上玩家更早进入战斗并反败为胜，而在另一台机器上玩家到达的更晚，然后，嗯，没有取得胜利。就像一只蝴蝶扇动了翅膀，然后在世界的另一边导致了飓风的出现，随着时间的过去，一个微小的区别会导致两边完全的不同步。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">另一个限制因素就是为了保证游戏在所有机器上表现同步，就有必要在游戏操作在设备上模拟之前进行等待，直到设备接收到了所有玩家对于那个变动的指令。这就意味着游戏中的每一个玩家的延迟都等于延迟最高玩家的延迟。<span>RTS</span>游戏通常代表性地通过立即提供音频反馈与（或是）播放过渡动画来掩盖这段延迟，但是最终真正影响游戏的操作要在这段延迟过去之后才能进行。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">最后一个限制因素就在于游戏的同步方式是通过发送改变当前状态的命令消息。为了让其正常工作就有必要让所有的玩家由同一初始状态开始游戏。通常来说，这就意味着每个玩家都要在开始游戏之前进入房间准备游戏，尽管支持让玩家随后加入游戏从技术上来说是可行的，但是由于在一场进行中的游戏中间捕获与传输一个完全确定的起始点的难度很大，所以这种情况并不常见。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">尽管有这些限制，这个模型还是很适合<span>RTS</span>游戏的，并且在现代的游戏中它仍然存在，例如“命令与征服”、“帝国时代”与“星际争霸”等。原因就是在<span>RTS</span>游戏中，游戏状态包含了成千上万的单位，并且通常游戏状态太大而不能在玩家之间交换。这些游戏别无选择，只能交换这些驱动着游戏状态改变的指令。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">但是对于其他类别的游戏，美工的状态已经改变了。所以对于确定的对等网络同步模型就讲到这里。现在让我们从<span>Doom</span>（毁灭战士）、<span>Quake</span>（雷神之锤）以及<span>Unreal</span>（魔域幻境）中看看动作类游戏的演变。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:400%"><span style="font-size:15.0pt;line-height:400%;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><b>客户端<span>/</span>服务器（<span>C/S</span>结构）</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">在动作游戏的时代，对等同步的限制因素在<span>Doom</span>中表现得更加明显，尽管它在局域网中表现很好，但是在面对互联网中的普通用户时表现得很糟糕：</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">“虽然可以通过调制解调器将两个运行<span>DOOM</span>的设备在互联网上连接在一起，最终游戏将会变得缓慢，延迟的情况在完全不能进行游戏（例如一个<span>14.4Kbps</span>的<span>P2P</span>连接）到略微可玩（例如一个<span>28.8Kbps</span>的调制解调器运行一个压缩驱动程序）之间不等。<u>因为这些类型的连接只有边际效用，本文将只关注于网络连接。</u>（</span><span><a

style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这个问题显然就是<span>Doom</span>本来就是只为局域网设计的，并且使用了前面描述的为<span>RTS</span>游戏制作的对等同步模型。每一个玩家输入的行为（关键按键等等）与其他人进行信息交换，只有在所有其他玩家的关键按键都被接收到之后，玩家才能够进行游戏画面的模拟。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">换句话说，在你能够操作、移动或是射击之前，你必须等待延迟最高的玩家进行连入。想想这上述的所谓“这些连接只有边际效用”将会导致的令人咬牙切齿的情况。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">现在的游戏局限于局域网游戏以及拥有良好连接条件的大学网络或是大公司的精英之间的游戏，为了改变这种情况，是时候改变这个模型了。这就是<span>John Carmack 1996</span>年在发布雷神之锤时所做的事情——他使用客户端<span>/</span>服务器（<span>C/S</span>结构）代替了对等同步模型（<span>P2P</span>）。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">现在，玩家们不再运行相同的游戏代码，直接地互相交换数据，如今每个玩家都是一个客户端，他们都与一台叫做<span>“</span>服务器<span>”</span>的电脑进行数据交换。现在的游戏不再有任何对于所有机器都要进行确定的要求，因为游戏实际上只存在于服务器上。每个客户端实际上都是作为哑终端，用来显示出一个游戏的近似情况，因为游戏实际上只在服务器上发生。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">在一个纯粹的客户端<span>/</span>服务器模型中你没有在本地运行游戏代码，而是将你的操作例如按键、鼠标移动、点击等发送到服务器。服务器响应并更新了虚拟世界中你的角色状态，然后将一个包含着你与你周围角色状态的数据包传回。所有客户端要做的事情就是在这些数据更新之间插入自己的数据，然后给你一种流畅移动的假象，然后，<span>boom</span>！你就有了一个联网的客户端<span>/</span>服务器游戏了。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这是一个伟大的进步。游戏体验的质量现在取决于客户端与服务器之间的连接，而不是取决于游戏中延迟最高的玩家。这同时让玩家在游戏进行中的加入变成了可能，并且随着客户端<span>/</span>服务器结构对于每位玩家需要的平均带宽减少，游戏玩家也在逐渐增长。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">但是对于纯粹的客户端<span>/</span>服务器模型仍然存在一些问题。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">“尽管我能记得并整理出我从<span>DOOM</span>到<span>Quake</span>做出的所有关于网络的决定，结果就是尽管我为了做出一个好的网络游戏而努力着，但这些努力都是基于一个错误的基础假设。我原先的设计目标就是使延迟低于<span>200ms</span>。这样的话通过一个好的供应商数字连接到网络的人，就能有一个很好的游戏体验。很不幸，世界上百分之九十就都是通过调制解调器进行<span>SLIP</span>连接或是<span>PPP</span>连接，它们通常是通过一个糟糕拥挤的<span>ISP</span>（网络服务提供者）进行连接的。这就导致了<span>300ms</span>以上的延迟，并且这只是最低值。客户端，使用者的调制解调器，<span>ISP</span>的调制解调器，服务器，再回到<span>ISP</span>的调制解调器，使用者的调制解调器，最后再回到客户端。天呐，这真是糟透了！</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">好吧，我做了一件错误的事。我在家里都使用<span>T1</span>载体进行联网，所以我对使用<span>P2P</span>的生活并不了解，我现在就解决这个问题。”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">问题当然就是延迟。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">接下来<span>John</span>在他发布<span>QuakeWorld</span>（雷神世界）时做的事情将永久改变这个行业。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"

style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">在最初的雷神之锤中，你可以明显感受到你的电脑与服务器之间的延迟。在你向前点击之后，你需要等待数据包发送至服务器然后再传回到你的电脑，然后你才能够开始移动。点击开火，然后你在射击之前同样需要等待上述延迟。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">如果你玩过任何像《使命召唤<span>4</span>：现代战争》之类的现代<span>FPS</span>游戏，你就会知道这种情况现在已经不会再出现了。那么现代<span>FPS</span>游戏到底是如何做到在多人游戏中看似消除了你自己行为的延迟呢？</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这个问题在历史上分两个部分来解决。第一部分就是<span>JohnCarmack</span>为雷神世界开发的客户端移动预测，它后来被合并作为<span>Tim Sweeney</span>的魔域幻境网络模型的一部分。第二部分就是维尔福公司的<span>Yahn Bernier</span>为反恐精英开发的延迟补偿。在本节中，我们将主要讨论第一部分<span>——</span>如何隐藏玩家移动的延迟。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">当谈到他对于即将发布的雷神世界的计划时，<span>JohnCarmack</span>说：</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">“我们现在允许客户端预测使用者行动的结果，直到服务器传来命令式回复。这是一个非常非常大的架构变化。客户端现在需要知道物体的硬度、摩擦力、重力之类的数据。对于简洁的客户端作为终端计划我们已经不再采用了，我对此表示遗憾，但我是一个实用主义者而不是一个理想主义者。”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">所以为了消除延迟，客户端需要比之前运行更多的代码。它现在不再是一个向服务器发送输入内容并在状态发回之前进行数据插入的哑终端，它现在能够在本地预测你的角色移动，并且对你的输入迅速做出反应，在客户端设备上为你的游戏角色运行一部分游戏代码。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">现在只要你向前点击，不需要再等待客户端与服务器之间的信息往返——你的角色立即开始向前移动。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这种方法的难点不在于预测，因为预测就像是普通游戏代码做的那样——根据玩家的操作随时间发展游戏角色状态。难点就在于，当客户端和服务器对于游戏角色所处的位置及所做的事情有分歧时，客户端如何以服务器传来的信息为基础进行修正。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">对于这一点，你可能会想，嘿，如果你在客户端运行游戏代码——为什么不以客户端的情况作为游戏角色的标准呢。客户端可以为自己的角色运行仿真代码，并在每次发送数据包时告诉服务器现在的情况。那么问题就是，如果每个玩家都可以简单地告诉服务器“这就是我现在的情况”，那就非常容易黑进客户端进行作弊，例如作弊者可以瞬间躲开将要射向他们的子弹，或者立即传送到你身后从后方射击你。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">所以在<span>FPS</span>游戏中，尽管每个玩家在本地预测自己角色的运动，从表面上隐藏了延迟，但以服务器状态作为每个玩家角色状态的标准是绝对有必要的。就像<span>Tim Sweeney</span>在</span><span><a rel="noopener" href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Network.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">UE</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span>网络架构</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">里写到的：“服务器才是大哥！”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这就是有趣的地方。如果客户端和服务器信息不一致，客户端就必须接受来自服务器的位置更新，但是由于客户端与服务器之间的延迟，这个对过去修正是必然的。举个例子，如果从客户端到服务器要消耗<span>100ms</span>，再经过<span>100ms</span>回来，那么任何服务器对于玩家角色位置的修正就会有<span>200ms</span>的延迟，这个时间是相对于客户端开始预测自己移动的时间。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">如果客户端连续接收服务器的修正更新，这就会及时拉回客户端，这就会导致客户端完全不能做任何客户端预测。怎么解决这个问题的同时仍然允许客户端进行超前预测呢？</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">解决方法就是在客户端为过去的角色状态以及本地玩家的输入创建一个循环缓冲区，然后当客户端收到一个来自服务器的修正，（首先它丢弃比服务器的修正状态更早的缓冲状态）依据玩家储存在循环缓冲区的输入对由上一次的正确状态开始到现在预测时间的状态进行重放。实际上客户端在等待接下来的情况匹配完成之前悄悄地“倒放与重放”当地的玩家角色移动的最后几帧。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">这个方法可以让玩家看似无延迟地控制他们的角色，并且如果客户端与服务器的角色模拟代码一致的话——由于在客户端与服务器上相同的输入可以准确给出相同的结果——这就很少出现要修正的情况。这就像是<span>Tim Sweeney</span>描述的那样：</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">“<span>……</span>最好的两个世界：在所有情况下，服务器都是绝对权威。在几乎任何时间内，客户端的移动模拟都与服务器计算出的客户端移动完全相同，所以客户端的情况很少需要修正。只有在极少的情况，例如玩家被一枚火箭击中，或是撞上一名敌人，客户端的情况将被修正。”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">换句话说，只有当玩家的角色被一些外部事情影响到了玩家的输入，并且这些不能被客户端所预测时，玩家的情况需要被修正。当然，如果玩家试图作弊时亦然。</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"

<p></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p></p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://gafferongames.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glenn Fiedler</a> and welcome to <a href="https://gafferongames.com/categories/game-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Networking for Game Programmers</strong></a>.</p><br><p>In the <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/virtual_connection_over_udp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a>, we added our own concept of virtual connection on top of UDP. In this article we’re going to add reliability, ordering and congestion avoidance to our virtual UDP connection.</p><br><h2 id="the-problem-with-tcp">The Problem with TCP</h2><br><p>Those of you familiar with TCP know that it already has its own concept of connection, reliability-ordering and congestion avoidance, so why are we rewriting our own mini version of TCP on top of UDP?</p><br><p>The issue is that multiplayer action games rely on a steady stream of packets sent at rates of 10 to 30 packets per second, and for the most part, the data contained is these packets is so time sensitive that only the most recent data is useful. This includes data such as player inputs, the position, orientation and velocity of each player character, and the state of physics objects in the world.</p><br><p>The problem with TCP is that it abstracts data delivery as a reliable ordered stream. Because of this, if a packet is lost, TCP has to stop and wait for that packet to be resent. This interrupts the steady stream of packets because more recent packets must wait in a queue until the resent packet arrives, so packets are received in the same order they were sent.</p><br><p>What we need is a different type of reliability. Instead of having all data treated as a reliable ordered stream, we want to send packets at a steady rate and get notified when packets are received by the other computer. This allows time sensitive data to get through without waiting for resent packets, while letting us make our own decision about how to handle packet loss at the application level.</p><br><p>It is not possible to implement a reliability system with these properties using TCP, so we have no choice but to roll our own reliability on top of UDP.</p><br><h2 id="sequence-numbers">Sequence Numbers</h2><br><p>The goal of our reliability system is simple: we want to know which packets arrive at the other side of the connection.</p><br><p>First we need a way to identify packets.</p><br><p>What if we had added the concept of a &ldquo;packet id&rdquo;? Let&rsquo;s make it an integer value. We could start this at zero then with each packet we send, increase the number by one. The first packet we send would be packet 0, and the 100th packet sent is packet 99.</p><br><p>This is actually quite a common technique. It&rsquo;s even used in TCP! These packet ids are called sequence numbers. While we’re not going to implement reliability exactly as TCP does, it makes sense to use the same terminology, so we’ll call them sequence numbers from now on.</p><br><p>Since UDP does not guarantee the order of packets, the 100th packet received is not necessarily the 100th packet sent. It follows that we need to insert the sequence number somewhere in the packet, so that the computer at the other side of the connection knows which packet it is.</p><br><p>We already have a simple packet header for the virtual connection from the previous article, so we&rsquo;ll just add the sequence number in the header like this:</p><br><pre>   [uint protocol id]<br>   [uint sequence]<br>   <em>(packet data…)</em></pre><br><p>Now when the other computer receives a packet it knows its sequence number according to the computer that sent it.</p><br><h2 id="acks">Acks</h2><br><p>Now that we can identify packets using sequence numbers, the next step is to let the other side of the connection know which packets we receive.</p><br><p>Logically this is quite simple, we just need to take note of the sequence number of each packet we receive, and send those sequence numbers back to the computer that sent them.</p><br><p>Because we are sending packets continuously between both machines, we can just add the ack to the packet header, just like we did with the sequence number:</p><br><pre>    [uint protocol id]<br>    [uint sequence]<br>    [uint ack]<br>    <em>(packet data…)</em></pre><br><p>Our general approach is as follows:</p><br><ul><br><li><p>Each time we send a packet we increase the <em>local sequence number</em></p></li><br><li><p>When we receieve a packet, we check the sequence number of the packet against the sequence number of the most recently received packet, called the <em>remote sequence number</em>. If the packet is more recent, we update the remote sequence to be equal to the sequence number of the packet.</p></li><br><li><p>When we compose packet headers, the local sequence becomes the sequence number of the packet, and the remote sequence becomes the ack.</p></li><br></ul><br><p>This simple ack system works provided that one packet comes in for each packet we send out.</p><br><p>But what if packets clump up such that two packets arrive before we send a packet? We only have space for one ack per-packet, so what do we do?</p><br><p>Now consider the case where one side of the connection is sending packets at a faster rate. If the client sends 30 packets per-second, and the server only sends 10 packets per-second, we need <em>at least</em> 3 acks included in each packet sent from the server.</p><br><p>Let&rsquo;s make it even more complex! What if the packet containing the ack is lost? The computer that sent the packet would think the packet got lost but it was actually received!</p><br><p>It seems like we need to make our reliability system&hellip; <em>more reliable!</em></p><br><h2 id="reliable-acks">Reliable Acks</h2><br><p>Here is where we diverge significantly from TCP.</p><br><p>What TCP does is maintain a sliding window where the ack sent is the sequence number of the next packet it expects to receive, in order. If TCP does not receive an ack for a given packet, it stops and resends a packet with that sequence number again. This is exactly the behavior we want to avoid!</p><br><p>In our reliability system, we never resend a packet with a given sequence number. We sequence n exactly once, then we send n+1, n+2 and so on. We never stop and resend packet n if it was lost, we leave it up to the application to compose a new packet containing the data that was lost, if necessary, and this packet gets sent with a new sequence number.</p><br><p>Because we&rsquo;re doing things differently to TCP, its now possible to have <em>holes</em> in the set of packets we ack, so it is no longer sufficient to just state the sequence number of the most recent packet we have received.</p><br><p>We need to include multiple acks per-packet.</p><br><p>How many acks do we need?</p><br><p>As mentioned previously we have the case where one side of the connection sends packets faster than the other. Let&rsquo;s assume that the worst case is one side sending no less than 10 packets per-second, while the other sends no more than 30. In this case, the average number of acks we&rsquo;ll need per-packet is 3, but if packets clump up a bit, we would need more. Let&rsquo;s say 6-10 worst case.</p><br><p>What about acks that don&rsquo;t get through because the packet containing the ack is lost?</p><br><p>To solve this, we&rsquo;re going to use a classic networking strategy of using redundancy to defeat packet loss!</p><br><p>Let&rsquo;s include 33 acks per-packet, and this isn&rsquo;t just going to be up to 33, but <em>always</em> 33. So for any given ack we <span style="text-decoration:underline;">redundantly</span> send it up to 32 additional times, just in case one packet with the ack doesn&rsquo;t get through!</p><br><p>But how can we possibly fit 33 acks in a packet? At 4 bytes per-ack thats 132 bytes!</p><br><p>The trick is to represent the 32 previous acks before &ldquo;ack&rdquo; using a bitfield:</p><br><pre><code>    [uint protocol id]<br>    [uint sequence]<br>    [uint ack]<br>    [uint ack bitfield]<br>    &lt;em&gt;(packet data…)&lt;/em&gt;<br></code></pre><br><p>We define &ldquo;ack bitfield&rdquo; such that each bit corresponds to acks of the 32 sequence numbers before &ldquo;ack&rdquo;. So let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;ack&rdquo; is 100. If the first bit of &ldquo;ack bitfield&rdquo; is set, then the packet also includes an ack for packet 99. If the second bit is set, then packet 98 is acked. This goes all the way down to the 32nd bit for packet 68.</p><br><p>Our adjusted algorithm looks like this:</p><br><ul><br><li><p>Each time we send a packet we increase the <em>local sequence number</em></p></li><br><li><p>When we receive a packet, we check the sequence number of the packet against the <em>remote sequence number</em>. If the packet sequence is more recent, we update the remote sequence number.</p></li><br><li><p>When we compose packet headers, the local sequence becomes the sequence number of the packet, and the remote sequence becomes the ack. The ack bitfield is calculated by looking into a queue of up to 33 packets, containing sequence numbers in the range [remote sequence - 32, remote sequence]. We set bit n (in [1,32]) in ack bits to 1 if the sequence number remote sequence - n is in the received queue.</p></li><br><li><p>Additionally, when a packet is received, ack bitfield is scanned and if bit n is set, then we acknowledge sequence number packet sequence - n, if it has not been acked already.</p></li><br></ul><br><p>With this improved algorithm, you would have to lose 100% of packets for more than a second to stop an ack getting through. And of course, it easily handles different send rates and clumped up packet receives.</p><br><h2 id="detecting-lost-packets">Detecting Lost Packets</h2><br><p>Now that we know what packets are received by the other side of the connection, how do we detect packet loss?</p><br><p>The trick here is to flip it around and say that if you don&rsquo;t get an ack for a packet within a certain amount of time, then we consider that packet lost.</p><br><p>Given that we are sending at no more than 30 packets per second, and we are redundantly sending acks roughly 30 times, if you don&rsquo;t get an ack for a packet within one second, it is <em>very</em> likely that packet was lost.</p><br><p>So we are playing a bit of a trick here, while we can know 100% for sure which packets get through, but we can only be <em>reasonably</em> certain of the set of packets that didn&rsquo;t arrive.</p><br><p>The implication of this is that any data which you resend using this reliability technique needs to have its own message id so that if you receive it multiple times, you can discard it. This can be done at the application level.</p><br><h2 id="handling-sequence-number-wrap-around">Handling Sequence Number Wrap-Around</h2><br><p>No discussion of sequence numbers and acks would be complete without coverage of sequence number wrap around!</p><br><p>Sequence numbers and acks are 32 bit unsigned integers, so they can represent numbers in the range [0,4294967295]. Thats a very high number! So high that if you sent 30 packets per-second, it would take over four and a half years for the sequence number to wrap back around to zero.</p><br><p>But perhaps you want to save some bandwidth so you shorten your sequence numbers and acks to 16 bit integers. You save 4 bytes per-packet, but now they wrap around in only half an hour.</p><br><p>So how do we handle this wrap around case?</p><br><p>The trick is to realize that if the current sequence number is already very high, and the next sequence number that comes in is very low, then you must have wrapped around. So even though the new sequence number is <em>numerically</em> lower than the current sequence value, it actually represents a more recent packet.</p><br><p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we encoded sequence numbers in one byte (not recommended btw. :)), then they would wrap around after 255 like this:</p><br><pre>    … 252, 253, 254, 255, 0, 1, 2, 3, …</pre><br><p>To handle this case we need a new function that is aware of the fact that sequence numbers wrap around to zero after 255, so that 0, 1, 2, 3 are considered more recent than 255. Otherwise, our reliability system stops working after you receive packet 255.</p><br><p>Here&rsquo;s a function for 16 bit sequence numbers:</p><br><pre><code>    inline bool sequence_greater_than( uint16_t s1, uint16_t s2 )<br>    {<br>        return ( ( s1 &gt; s2 ) &amp;&amp; ( s1 - s2 &lt;= 32768 ) ) ||<br>               ( ( s1 &lt; s2 ) &amp;&amp; ( s2 - s1  &gt; 32768 ) );<br>    }<br></code></pre><br><p>This function works by comparing the two numbers <em>and</em> their difference. If their difference is less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the maximum sequence number value, then they must be close together - so we just check if one is greater than the other, as usual. However, if they are far apart, their difference will be greater than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the max sequence, then we paradoxically consider the sequence number more recent if it is <em>less</em> than the current sequence number.</p><br><p>This last bit is what handles the wrap around of sequence numbers transparently, so 0,1,2 are considered more recent than 255.</p><br><p>Make sure you include this in any sequence number processing you do.</p><br><h2 id="congestion-avoidance">Congestion Avoidance</h2><br><p>While we have solved reliability, there is still the question of congestion avoidance. TCP provides congestion avoidance as part of the packet when you get TCP reliability, but UDP has no congestion avoidance whatsoever!</p><br><p>If we just send packets without some sort of flow control, we risk flooding the connection and inducing severe latency (2 seconds plus!) as routers between us and the other computer become congested and buffer up packets. This happens because routers try <em>very hard</em> to deliver all the packets we send, and therefore tend to buffer up packets in a queue before they consider dropping them.</p><br><p>While it would be nice if we could tell the routers that our packets are time sensitive and should be dropped instead of buffered if the router is overloaded, we can&rsquo;t really do this without rewriting the software for all routers in the world.</p><br><p>Instead, we need to focus on what we can actually do which is to avoid flooding the connection in the first place. We try to avoid sending too much bandwidth in the first place, and then if we detect congestion, we attempt to back off and send even less.</p><br><p>The way to do this is to implement our own basic congestion avoidance algorithm. And I stress basic! Just like reliability, we have no hope of coming up with something as general and robust as TCP&rsquo;s implementation on the first try, so let&rsquo;s keep it as simple as possible.</p><br><h2 id="measuring-round-trip-time">Measuring Round Trip Time</h2><br><p>Since the whole point of congestion avoidance is to avoid flooding the connection and increasing round trip time (RTT), it makes sense that the most important metric as to whether or not we are flooding our connection is the RTT itself.</p><br><p>We need a way to measure the RTT of our connection.</p><br><p>Here is the basic technique:</p><br><ul><br><li><p>For each packet we send, we add an entry to a queue containing the sequence number of the packet and the time it was sent.</p></li><br><li><p>Each time we receive an ack, we look up this entry and note the difference in local time between the time we receive the ack, and the time we sent the packet. This is the RTT time for that packet.</p></li><br><li><p>Because the arrival of packets varies with network jitter, we need to smooth this value to provide something meaningful, so each time we obtain a new RTT we move a percentage of the distance between our current RTT and the packet RTT. 10% seems to work well for me in practice. This is called an exponentially smoothed moving average, and it has the effect of smoothing out noise in the RTT with a low pass filter.</p></li><br><li><p>To ensure that the sent queue doesn&rsquo;t grow forever, we discard packets once they have exceeded some maximum expected RTT. As discussed in the previous section on reliability, it is exceptionally likely that any packet not acked within a second was lost, so one second is a good value for this maximum RTT.</p></li><br></ul><br><p>Now that we have RTT, we can use it as a metric to drive our congestion avoidance. If RTT gets too large, we send data less frequently, if its within acceptable ranges, we can try sending data more frequently.</p><br><h2 id="simple-binary-congestion-avoidance">Simple Binary Congestion Avoidance</h2><br><p>As discussed before, let&rsquo;s not get greedy, we&rsquo;ll implement a very basic congestion avoidance. This congestion avoidance has two modes. Good and bad. I call it simple binary congestion avoidance.</p><br><p>Let&rsquo;s assume you send packets of a certain size, say 256 bytes. You would like to send these packets 30 times a second, but if conditions are bad, you can drop down to 10 times a second.</p><br><p>So 256 byte packets 30 times a second is around 64kbits/sec, and 10 times a second is roughly 20kbit/sec. There isn&rsquo;t a broadband network connection in the world that can&rsquo;t handle at least 20kbit/sec, so we&rsquo;ll move forward with this assumption. Unlike TCP which is entirely general for any device with any amount of send/recv bandwidth, we&rsquo;re going to assume a minimum supported bandwidth for devices involved in our connections.</p><br><p>So the basic idea is this. When network conditions are &ldquo;good&rdquo; we send 30 packets per-second, and when network conditions are &ldquo;bad&rdquo; we drop to 10 packets per-second.</p><br><p>Of course, you can define &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; however you like, but I&rsquo;ve gotten good results considering only RTT. For example if RTT exceeds some threshold (say 250ms) then you know you are probably flooding the connection. Of course, this assumes that nobody would normally exceed 250ms under non-flooding conditions, which is reasonable given our broadband requirement.</p><br><p>How do you switch between good and bad? The algorithm I like to use operates as follows:</p><br><ul><br><li><p>If you are currently in good mode, and conditions become bad, immediately drop to bad mode</p></li><br><li><p>If you are in bad mode, and conditions have been good for a specific length of time &rsquo;t&rsquo;, then return to good mode</p></li><br><li><p>To avoid rapid toggling between good and bad mode, if you drop from good mode to bad in under 10 seconds, double the amount of time &rsquo;t&rsquo; before bad mode goes back to good. Clamp this at some maximum, say 60 seconds.</p></li><br><li><p>To avoid punishing good connections when they have short periods of bad behavior, for each 10 seconds the connection is in good mode, halve the time &rsquo;t&rsquo; before bad mode goes back to good. Clamp this at some minimum like 1 second.</p></li><br></ul><br><p>With this algorithm you will rapidly respond to bad conditions and drop your send rate to 10 packets per-second, avoiding flooding of the connection. You&rsquo;ll also <em>conservatively</em> try out good mode, and persist sending packets at a higher rate of 30 packets per-second, while network conditions are good.</p><br><p>Of course, you can implement much more sophisticated algorithms. Packet loss % can be taken into account as a metric, even the amount of network jitter (time variance in packet acks), not just RTT.</p><br><p>You can also get much more <em>greedy</em> with congestion avoidance, and attempt to discover when you can send data at a much higher bandwidth (eg. LAN), but you have to be very careful! With increased greediness comes more risk that you&rsquo;ll flood the connection.</p><br><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><br><p>Our new reliability system let&rsquo;s us send a steady stream of packets and notifies us which packets are received. From this we can infer lost packets, and resend data that didn&rsquo;t get through if necessary. We also have a simple congestion avoidance system that drops from 30 packets per-second to 10 times a second so we don&rsquo;t flood the connection.</p>

<p></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p></p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://gafferongames.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glenn Fiedler</a> and welcome to <a href="https://gafferongames.com/categories/game-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Networking for Game Programmers</strong></a>.</p><br><p>In the <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/sending_and_receiving_packets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a> we sent and received packets over UDP. Since UDP is connectionless, one UDP socket can be used to exchange packets with any number of different computers. In multiplayer games however, we usually only want to exchange packets between a small set of connected computers.</p><br><p>As the first step towards a general connection system, we&rsquo;ll start with the simplest case possible: creating a virtual connection between two computers on top of UDP.</p><br><p>But first, we&rsquo;re going to dig in a bit deeper about how the Internet really works!</p><br><h2 id="the-internet-u-not-u-a-series-of-tubes">The Internet <u>NOT</u> a series of tubes</h2><br><p>In 2006, Senator Ted Stevens made internet history with his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous speech</a> on the net neutrality act:</p><br><blockquote>“The internet is not something that you just dump something on. It’s not a big truck. It’s a series of tubes”</blockquote><br><p>When I first started using the Internet, I was just like Ted. Sitting in the computer lab in University of Sydney in 1995, I was &ldquo;surfing the web&rdquo; with this new thing called Netscape Navigator, and I had absolutely no idea what was going on.</p><br><p>You see, I thought each time you connected to a website there was some actual connection going on, like a telephone line. I wondered, how much does it cost each time I connect to a new website? 30 cents? A dollar? Was somebody from the university going to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to pay the long distance charges? :)</p><br><p>Of course, this all seems silly now.</p><br><p>There is no switchboard somewhere that directly connects you via a physical phone line to the other computer you want to talk to, let alone a series of pneumatic tubes like Sen. Stevens would have you believe.</p><br><h2 id="no-direct-connections">No Direct Connections</h2><br><p>Instead your data is sent over Internet Protocol (IP) via packets that hop from computer to computer.</p><br><p>A packet may pass through several computers before it reaches its destination. You cannot know the exact set of computers in advance, as it changes dynamically depending on how the network decides to route packets. You could even send two packets A and B to the same address, and they may take different routes.</p><br><p>On unix-like systems can inspect the route that packets take by calling &ldquo;traceroute&rdquo; and passing in a destination hostname or IP address.</p><br><p>On windows, replace &ldquo;traceroute&rdquo; with &ldquo;tracert&rdquo; to get it to work.</p><br><p>Try it with a few websites like this:</p><br><pre>    traceroute slashdot.org<br>    traceroute amazon.com<br>    traceroute google.com<br>    traceroute bbc.co.uk<br>    traceroute news.com.au<br></pre><br><p>Take a look and you should be able to convince yourself pretty quickly that there is no direct connection.</p><br><h2 id="how-packets-get-delivered">How Packets Get Delivered</h2><br><p>In the <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/udp_vs_tcp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first article</a>, I presented a simple analogy for packet delivery, describing it as somewhat like a note being passed from person to person across a crowded room.</p><br><p>While this analogy gets the basic idea across, it is much too simple. The Internet is <u>not</u> a flat network of computers, it is a network of networks. And of course, we don&rsquo;t just need to pass letters around a small room, we need to be able to send them anywhere in the world.</p><br><p>It should be pretty clear then that the best analogy is the postal service!</p><br><p>When you want to send a letter to somebody you put your letter in the mailbox and you trust that it will be delivered correctly. It&rsquo;s not really relevant to you <i>how</i> it gets there, as long as it does. Somebody has to physically deliver your letter to its destination of course, so how is this done?</p><br><p>Well first off, the postman sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t take your letter and deliver it personally! It seems that the postal service is not a series of tubes either. Instead, the postman takes your letter to the local post office for processing.</p><br><p>If the letter is addressed locally then the post office just sends it back out, and another postman delivers it directly. But, if the address is is non-local then it gets interesting! The local post office is not able to deliver the letter directly, so it passes it &ldquo;up&rdquo; to the next level of hierarchy, perhaps to a regional post office which services cities nearby, or maybe to a mail center at an airport, if the address is far away. Ideally, the actual transport of the letter would be done using a <u>big truck</u>.</p><br><p>Lets be complicated and assume the letter is sent from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia. The local post office receives the letter and given that it is addressed internationally, sends it directly to a mail center at LAX. The letter is processed again according to address, and gets routed on the next flight to Sydney.</p><br><p>The plane lands at Sydney airport where an <i>entirely different postal system</i> takes over. Now the whole process starts operating in reverse. The letter travels &ldquo;down&rdquo; the hierarchy, from the general, to the specific. From the mail hub at Sydney Airport it gets sent out to a regional center, the regional center delivers it to the local post office, and eventually the letter is hand delivered by a mailman with a funny accent. Crikey! :)</p><br><p>Just like post offices determine how to deliver letters via their address, networks deliver packets according to their IP address. The low-level details of this delivery and the actual routing of packets from network to network is actually quite complex, but the basic idea is that each router is just another computer, with a routing table describing where packets matching sets of addresses should go, as well as a default gateway address describing where to pass packets for which there is no matching entry in the table. It is routing tables, and the physical connections they represent that define the network of networks that is the Internet.</p><br><p>The job of configuring these routing tables is up to network administrators, not programmers like us. But if you want to read more about it, then this article from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/guides/other/peering-and-transit.ars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ars technica</a> provides some fascinating insight into how networks exchange packets between each other via peering and transit relationships. You can also read more details about <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_network/x-087-2-issues.routing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">routing tables</a> in this linux faq, and about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">border gateway protocol</a> on wikipedia, which automatically discovers how to route packets between networks, making the internet a truly distributed system capable of dynamically routing around broken connectivity.</p><br><h2 id="virtual-connections">Virtual Connections</h2><br><p>Now back to connections.</p><br><p>If you have used TCP sockets then you know that they sure <i>look</i> like a connection, but since TCP is implemented on top of IP, and IP is just packets hopping from computer to computer, it follows that TCP&rsquo;s concept of connection must be a <i>virtual connection.</i></p><br><p>If TCP can create a virtual connection over IP, it follows that we can do the same over UDP.</p><br><p>Lets define our virtual connection as two computers exchanging UDP packets at some fixed rate like 10 packets per-second. As long as the packets are flowing, we consider the two computers to be virtually connected.</p><br><p>Our connection has two sides:</p><br><ul><br><li>One computer sits there and <i>listens</i> for another computer to connect to it. We’ll call this computer the <u>server</u>.</li><br><li>Another computer <i>connects</i> to a server by specifying an IP address and port. We’ll call this computer the <u>client</u>.</li><br></ul><br><p>In our case, we only allow one client to connect to the server at any time. We&rsquo;ll generalize our connection system to support multiple simultaneous connections in a later article. Also, we assume that the IP address of the server is on a fixed IP address that the client may directly connect to.</p><br><h2 id="protocol-id">Protocol ID</h2><br><p>Since UDP is connectionless our UDP socket can receive packets sent from any computer.</p><br><p>We&rsquo;d like to narrow this down so that the server only receives packets sent from the client, and the client only receives packets sent from the server. We can&rsquo;t just filter out packets by address, because the server doesn&rsquo;t know the address of the client in advance. So instead, we prefix each UDP packet with small header containing a 32 bit protocol id as follows:</p><br><pre>    [uint protocol id]<br>    <i>(packet data…)</i><br></pre><br><p>The protocol id is just some unique number representing our game protocol. Any packet that arrives from our UDP socket first has its first four bytes inspected. If they don&rsquo;t match our protocol id, then the packet is ignored. If the protocol id does match, we strip out the first four bytes of the packet and deliver the rest as payload.</p><br><p>You just choose some number that is reasonably unique, perhaps a hash of the name of your game and the protocol version number. But really you can use anything. The whole point is that from the point of view of our connection based protocol, packets with different protocol ids are ignored.</p><br><h2 id="detecting-connection">Detecting Connection</h2><br><p>Now we need a way to detect connection.</p><br><p>Sure we could do some complex handshaking involving multiple UDP packets sent back and forth. Perhaps a client &ldquo;request connection&rdquo; packet is sent to the server, to which the server responds with a &ldquo;connection accepted&rdquo; sent back to the client, or maybe an &ldquo;i&rsquo;m busy&rdquo; packet if a client tries to connect to server which already has a connected client.</p><br><p>Or&hellip; we could just setup our server to take the first packet it receives with the correct protocol id, and consider a connection to be established.</p><br><p>The client just starts sending packets to the server assuming connection, when the server receives the first packet from the client, it takes note of the IP address and port of the client, and starts sending packets back.</p><br><p>The client already knows the address and port of the server, since it was specified on connect. So when the client receives packets, it filters out any that don&rsquo;t come from the server address. Similarly, once the server receives the first packet from the client, it gets the address and port of the client from &ldquo;recvfrom&rdquo;, so it is able to ignore any packets that don&rsquo;t come from the client address.</p><br><p>We can get away with this shortcut because we only have two computers involved in the connection. In later articles, we&rsquo;ll extend our connection system to support more than two computers in a client/server or peer-to-peer topology, and at this point we&rsquo;ll upgrade our connection negotiation to something more robust.</p><br><p>But for now, why make things more complicated than they need to be?</p><br><h2 id="detecting-disconnection">Detecting Disconnection</h2><br><p>How do we detect disconnection?</p><br><p>Well if a connection is defined as receiving packets, we can define disconnection as <i>not</i> receiving packets.</p><br><p>To detect when we are not receiving packets, we keep track of the number of seconds since we last received a packet from the other side of the connection. We do this on both sides.</p><br><p>Each time we receive a packet from the other side, we reset our accumulator to 0.0, each update we increase the accumulator by the amount of time that has passed.</p><br><p>If this accumulator exceeds some value like 10 seconds, the connection &ldquo;times out&rdquo; and we disconnect.</p><br><p>This also gracefully handles the case of a second client trying to connect to a server that has already made a connection with another client. Since the server is already connected it ignores packets coming from any address other than the connected client, so the second client receives no packets in response to the packets it sends, so the second client times out and disconnects.</p><br><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><br><p>And that&rsquo;s all it takes to setup a virtual connection: some way to establish connection, filtering for packets not involved in the connection, and timeouts to detect disconnection.</p><br><p>Our connection is as real as any TCP connection, and the steady stream of UDP packets it provides is a suitable starting point for a multiplayer action game.</p><br><p>Now that you have your virtual connection over UDP, you can easily setup a client/server relationship for a two player multiplayer game without TCP.</p>

<p></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p></p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://gafferongames.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glenn Fiedler</a> and welcome to <a href="https://gafferongames.com/categories/game-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Networking for Game Programmers</strong></a>.</p><br><p>In the <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/udp_vs_tcp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a> we discussed options for sending data between computers and decided to use UDP instead of TCP for time critical data.</p><br><p>In this article I am going to show you how to send and receive UDP packets.</p><br><h2 id="bsd-sockets">BSD sockets</h2><br><p>For most modern platforms you have some sort of basic socket layer available based on BSD sockets.</p><br><p>BSD sockets are manipulated using simple functions like &ldquo;socket&rdquo;, &ldquo;bind&rdquo;, &ldquo;sendto&rdquo; and &ldquo;recvfrom&rdquo;. You can of course work directly with these functions if you wish, but it becomes difficult to keep your code platform independent because each platform is slightly different.</p><br><p>So although I will first show you BSD socket example code to demonstrate basic socket usage, we won&rsquo;t be using BSD sockets directly for long. Once we&rsquo;ve covered all basic socket functionality we&rsquo;ll abstract everything away into a set of classes, making it easy to you to write platform independent socket code.</p><br><h2 id="platform-specifics">Platform specifics</h2><br><p>First let&rsquo;s setup a define so we can detect what our current platform is and handle the slight differences in sockets from one platform to another:</p><br><pre><code>    // platform detection<br><br>    #define PLATFORM_WINDOWS  1<br>    #define PLATFORM_MAC      2<br>    #define PLATFORM_UNIX     3<br><br>    #if defined(_WIN32)<br>    #define PLATFORM PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br>    #elif defined(<strong>APPLE</strong>)<br>    #define PLATFORM PLATFORM_MAC<br>    #else<br>    #define PLATFORM PLATFORM_UNIX<br>    #endif<br></code></pre><br><p>Now let&rsquo;s include the appropriate headers for sockets. Since the header files are platform specific, we&rsquo;ll use the platform #define to include different sets of files depending on the platform:</p><br><pre><code>    #if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br><br>        #include &lt;winsock2.h&gt;<br><br>    #elif PLATFORM == PLATFORM_MAC ||<br>          PLATFORM == PLATFORM_UNIX<br><br>        #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br>        #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;<br>        #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;<br><br>    #endif<br></code></pre><br><p>Sockets are built in to the standard system libraries on unix-based platforms so we don&rsquo;t have to link to any additonal libraries. However, on Windows we need to link to the winsock library to get socket functionality.</p><br><p>Here is a simple trick to do this without having to change your project or makefile:</p><br><pre><code>    #if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br>    #pragma comment( lib, &quot;wsock32.lib&quot; )<br>    #endif<br></code></pre><br><p>I like this trick because I&rsquo;m super lazy. You can always link from your project or makefile if you wish.</p><br><h2 id="initializing-the-socket-layer">Initializing the socket layer</h2><br><p>Most unix-like platforms (including macosx) don&rsquo;t require any specific steps to initialize the sockets layer, however Windows requires that you jump through some hoops to get your socket code working.</p><br><p>You must call &ldquo;WSAStartup&rdquo; to initialize the sockets layer before you call any socket functions, and &ldquo;WSACleanup&rdquo; to shutdown when you are done.</p><br><p>Let&rsquo;s add two new functions:</p><br><pre><code>    bool InitializeSockets()<br>    {<br>        #if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br>        WSADATA WsaData;<br>        return WSAStartup( MAKEWORD(2,2),<br>                           &amp;WsaData )<br>            == NO_ERROR;<br>        #else<br>        return true;<br>        #endif<br>    }<br><br>    void ShutdownSockets()<br>    {<br>        #if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br>        WSACleanup();<br>        #endif<br>    }<br></code></pre><br><p>Now we have a platform independent way to initialize the socket layer.</p><br><h2 id="creating-a-socket">Creating a socket</h2><br><p>It&rsquo;s time to create a UDP socket, here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p><br><pre><code>    int handle = socket( AF_INET,<br>                         SOCK_DGRAM,<br>                         IPPROTO_UDP );<br><br>    if ( handle &lt;= 0 )<br>    {<br>        printf( &quot;failed to create socket\n&quot; );<br>        return false;<br>    }<br></code></pre><br><p>Next we bind the UDP socket to a port number (eg. 30000). Each socket must be bound to a unique port, because when a packet arrives the port number determines which socket to deliver to. Don&rsquo;t use ports lower than 1024 because they are reserved for the system. Also try to avoid using ports above 50000 because they used when dynamically assigning ports.</p><br><p>Special case: if you don&rsquo;t care what port your socket gets bound to just pass in &ldquo;0&rdquo; as your port, and the system will select a free port for you.</p><br><pre><code>    sockaddr_in address;<br>    address.sin_family = AF_INET;<br>    address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;<br>    address.sin_port =<br>        htons( (unsigned short) port );<br><br>    if ( bind( handle,<br>               (const sockaddr<em>) &amp;address,<br>               sizeof(sockaddr_in) ) &lt; 0 )<br>    {<br>        printf( &quot;failed to bind socket\n&quot; );<br>        return false;<br>    }<br></em></code></pre><br><p>Now the socket is ready to send and receive packets.</p><br><p>But what is this mysterious call to &ldquo;htons&rdquo; in the code above? This is just a helper function that converts a 16 bit integer value from host byte order (little or big-endian) to network byte order (big-endian). This is required whenever you directly set integer members in socket structures.</p><br><p>You&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;htons&rdquo; (host to network short) and its 32 bit integer sized cousin &ldquo;htonl&rdquo; (host to network long) used several times throughout this article, so keep an eye out, and you&rsquo;ll know what is going on.</p><br><h2 id="setting-the-socket-as-non-blocking">Setting the socket as non-blocking</h2><br><p>By default sockets are set in what is called &ldquo;blocking mode&rdquo;.</p><br><p>This means that if you try to read a packet using &ldquo;recvfrom&rdquo;, the function will not return until a packet is available to read. This is not at all suitable for our purposes. Video games are realtime programs that simulate at 30 or 60 frames per second, they can&rsquo;t just sit there waiting for a packet to arrive!</p><br><p>The solution is to flip your sockets into &ldquo;non-blocking mode&rdquo; after you create them. Once this is done, the &ldquo;recvfrom&rdquo; function returns immediately when no packets are available to read, with a return value indicating that you should try to read packets again later.</p><br><p>Here&rsquo;s how put a socket in non-blocking mode:</p><br><pre><code>    #if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_MAC ||<br>        PLATFORM == PLATFORM_UNIX<br><br>        int nonBlocking = 1;<br>        if ( fcntl( handle,<br>                    F_SETFL,<br>                    O_NONBLOCK,<br>                    nonBlocking ) == -1 )<br>        {<br>            printf( &quot;failed to set non-blocking\n&quot; );<br>            return false;<br>        }<br><br>    #elif PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br><br>        DWORD nonBlocking = 1;<br>        if ( ioctlsocket( handle,<br>                          FIONBIO,<br>                          &amp;nonBlocking ) != 0 )<br>        {<br>            printf( &quot;failed to set non-blocking\n&quot; );<br>            return false;<br>        }<br><br>    #endif<br></code></pre><br><p>Windows does not provide the &ldquo;fcntl&rdquo; function, so we use the &ldquo;ioctlsocket&rdquo; function instead.</p><br><h2 id="sending-packets">Sending packets</h2><br><p>UDP is a connectionless protocol, so each time you send a packet you must specify the destination address. This means you can use one UDP socket to send packets to any number of different IP addresses, there&rsquo;s no single computer at the other end of your UDP socket that you are connected to.</p><br><p>Here&rsquo;s how to send a packet to a specific address:</p><br><pre><code>    int sent_bytes =<br>        sendto( handle,<br>                (const char)packet_data,<br>                packet_size,<br>                0,<br>                (sockaddr<em>)&amp;address,<br>                sizeof(sockaddr_in) );<br><br>    if ( sent_bytes != packet_size )<br>    {<br>        printf( &quot;failed to send packet\n&quot; );<br>        return false;<br>    }<br></em></code></pre><br><p>Important! The return value from &ldquo;sendto&rdquo; only indicates if the packet was successfully sent from the local computer. It does <em>not</em> tell you whether or not the packet was received by the destination computer. UDP has no way of knowing whether or not the the packet arrived at its destination!</p><br><p>In the code above we pass a &ldquo;sockaddr_in&rdquo; structure as the destination address. How do we setup one of these structures?</p><br><p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to send to the address 207.45.186.98:30000</p><br><p>Starting with our address in this form:</p><br><pre><code>    unsigned int a = 207;<br>    unsigned int b = 45;<br>    unsigned int c = 186;<br>    unsigned int d = 98;<br>    unsigned short port = 30000;<br></code></pre><br><p>We have a bit of work to do to get it in the form required by &ldquo;sendto&rdquo;:</p><br><pre><code>    unsigned int address = ( a &lt;&lt; 24 ) |<br>                           ( b &lt;&lt; 16 ) |<br>                           ( c &lt;&lt; 8  ) |<br>                             d;<br><br>    sockaddr_in addr;<br>    addr.sin_family = AF_INET;<br>    addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl( address );<br>    addr.sin_port = htons( port );<br></code></pre><br><p>As you can see, we first combine the a,b,c,d values in range [0,255] into a single unsigned integer, with each byte of the integer now corresponding to the input values. We then initialize a &ldquo;sockaddr_in&rdquo; structure with the integer address and port, making sure to convert our integer address and port values from host byte order to network byte order using &ldquo;htonl&rdquo; and &ldquo;htons&rdquo;.</p><br><p>Special case: if you want to send a packet to yourself, there&rsquo;s no need to query the IP address of your own machine, just pass in the loopback address 127.0.0.1 and the packet will be sent to your local machine.</p><br><h2 id="receiving-packets">Receiving packets</h2><br><p>Once you have a UDP socket bound to a port, any UDP packets sent to your sockets IP address and port are placed in a queue. To receive packets just loop and call &ldquo;recvfrom&rdquo; until it fails with EWOULDBLOCK indicating there are no more packets to receive.</p><br><p>Since UDP is connectionless, packets may arrive from any number of different computers. Each time you receive a packet &ldquo;recvfrom&rdquo; gives you the IP address and port of the sender, so you know where the packet came from.</p><br><p>Here&rsquo;s how to loop and receive all incoming packets:</p><br><pre><code>    while ( true )<br>    {<br>        unsigned char packet_data[256];<br><br>        unsigned int max_packet_size =<br>            sizeof( packet_data );<br><br>        #if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br>        typedef int socklen_t;<br>        #endif<br><br>        sockaddr_in from;<br>        socklen_t fromLength = sizeof( from );<br><br>        int bytes = recvfrom( socket,<br>                              (char)packet_data,<br>                              max_packet_size,<br>                              0,<br>                              (sockaddr<em>)&amp;from,<br>                              &amp;fromLength );<br><br>        if ( bytes &lt;= 0 )<br>            break;<br><br>        unsigned int from_address =<br>            ntohl( from.sin_addr.s_addr );<br><br>        unsigned int from_port =<br>            ntohs( from.sin_port );<br><br>        // process received packet<br>    }<br></em></code></pre><br><p>Any packets in the queue larger than your receive buffer will be silently discarded. So if you have a 256 byte buffer to receive packets like the code above, and somebody sends you a 300 byte packet, the 300 byte packet will be dropped. You <em>will not</em> receive just the first 256 bytes of the 300 byte packet.</p><br><p>Since you are writing your own game network protocol, this is no problem at all in practice, just make sure your receive buffer is big enough to receive the largest packet your code could possibly send.</p><br><h2 id="destroying-a-socket">Destroying a socket</h2><br><p>On most unix-like platforms, sockets are file handles so you use the standard file &ldquo;close&rdquo; function to clean up sockets once you are finished with them. However, Windows likes to be a little bit different, so we have to use &ldquo;closesocket&rdquo; instead:</p><br><pre>#if PLATFORM == PLATFORM_MAC ||<br>    PLATFORM == PLATFORM_UNIX<br>close( socket );<br>#elif PLATFORM == PLATFORM_WINDOWS<br>closesocket( socket );<br>#endif</pre><br><p>Hooray windows.</p><br><h2 id="socket-class">Socket class</h2><br><p>So we&rsquo;ve covered all the basic operations: creating a socket, binding it to a port, setting it to non-blocking, sending and receiving packets, and destroying the socket.</p><br><p>But you&rsquo;ll notice most of these operations are slightly platform dependent, and it&rsquo;s pretty annoying to have to remember to #ifdef and do platform specifics each time you want to perform socket operations.</p><br><p>We&rsquo;re going to solve this by wrapping all our socket functionality up into a &ldquo;Socket&rdquo; class. While we&rsquo;re at it, we&rsquo;ll add an &ldquo;Address&rdquo; class to make it easier to specify internet addresses. This avoids having to manually encode or decode a &ldquo;sockaddr_in&rdquo; structure each time we send or receive packets.</p><br><p>So let&rsquo;s add a socket class:</p><br><pre><code>    class Socket<br>    {<br>    public:<br><br>        Socket();<br><br>        ~Socket();<br><br>        bool Open( unsigned short port );<br><br>        void Close();<br><br>        bool IsOpen() const;<br><br>        bool Send( const Address &amp; destination,<br>                   const void  data,<br>                   int size );<br><br>        int Receive( Address &amp; sender,<br>                     void * data,<br>                     int size );<br><br>    private:<br><br>        int handle;<br>    };<br></code></pre><br><p>and an address class:</p><br><pre><code>    class Address<br>    {<br>    public:<br><br>        Address();<br><br>        Address( unsigned char a,<br>                 unsigned char b,<br>                 unsigned char c,<br>                 unsigned char d,<br>                 unsigned short port );<br><br>        Address( unsigned int address,<br>                 unsigned short port );<br><br>        unsigned int GetAddress() const;<br><br>        unsigned char GetA() const;<br>        unsigned char GetB() const;<br>        unsigned char GetC() const;<br>        unsigned char GetD() const;<br><br>        unsigned short GetPort() const;<br><br>    private:<br><br>        unsigned int address;<br>        unsigned short port;<br>    };<br></code></pre><br><p>Here&rsquo;s how to to send and receive packets with these classes:</p><br><pre><code>    // create socket<br><br>    const int port = 30000;<br><br>    Socket socket;<br><br>    if ( !socket.Open( port ) )<br>    {<br>        printf( &quot;failed to create socket!\n&quot; );<br>        return false;<br>    }<br><br>    // send a packet<br><br>    const char data[] = &quot;hello world!&quot;;<br><br>    socket.Send( Address(127,0,0,1,port), data, sizeof( data ) );<br><br>    // receive packets<br><br>    while ( true )<br>    {<br>        Address sender;<br>        unsigned char buffer[256];<br>        int bytes_read =<br>            socket.Receive( sender,<br>                            buffer,<br>                            sizeof( buffer ) );<br>        if ( !bytes_read )<br>            break;<br><br>        // process packet<br>    }<br></code></pre><br><p>As you can see it&rsquo;s much simpler than using BSD sockets directly.</p><br><p>As an added bonus the code is the same on all platforms because everything platform specific is handled inside the socket and address classes.</p><br><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><br><p>You now have a platform independent way to send and receive packets. <em>Enjoy</em> :)</p>

style="text-indent:24.0pt"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">对于大多数现代的平台来说你都可以找到建立在伯克利套接字上的</span><span>sockets</span><span

and “recvfr</span><span>om”</span><span

style="font-family:&quot;微软雅黑&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="font-size:medium;">您可以很容易地设置它，然后你就拥有了一系列在本地机器上互相发送数据包的节点。这样你就可以利用以下程序通过不同的端口，进入不同的应用程序：</span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
