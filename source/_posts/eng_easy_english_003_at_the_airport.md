# CHECK-IN

- Hello, may I see your passport, please? 
- > Here you go 
- thank you. And where are you flying with us today? 
- > I am going to London, i'll be studying there for a year. 
- How fun! that sounds like a great trip. I see your information right here. Are you `checking any bags`(put the bags on the airplane inside the `cargo`货物 `compartment`隔层) today? 
- > Yes, just one. 
- Perfect if you could place it on the `scale`(the equipment that tells you the weight ofyour luggage) for me, that would be great. 
- > Here you go, 
- thank you. Hmm, it appears your bag is just a bit too heavy. It's over our weight requirement. Perhaps you could take something out of your bag and put it in your `carry-on bag`(the small bag you take with you on the airplane)?
- > Yes, i'll take this big book out of the bag, no problem. 
- Great, now your bag is ready to be checked and I see you've chosen a window seat. Is that still OK for you? 
- > I think so. I've never flown before so I thought it would be nice to look out at the clouds. Do you think it will be a good seat for me? 
- This is your first flight? well, that's fantastic! you're going to love it. And yes, I think the window seat is an excellent choice for you then. Let me print your boarding pass and you'll be ready to go.
- > okay.
- Here it is, you're all set.
- > thanks.
- you're going to depart from terminal C Gate 54. (`terminal`: a building within an airport where passengers go to depart on a flight)
- > When do I need to be there? 
- You should get to your gate about one hour before `departure`(the time planes leave the airport). 
- And how do I get to the gate? 
- > You will turn left at the coffee shop. Security will be directly in front of you. Once you're finished `clearing security`(move through security successfully), follow the signs to Gate 54. It will be on your right. 
- Thank you so much for your help. 
- > You're very welcome, enjoy your flight !


# Security

- Passport and boarding pass, please.
- > here you go. 
- Thank you, you can go on through.
- > sir, you need to remove your coat, and your belt. 
- My coat? and my belt? 
- > yes. and your shoes. 
- my shoes too? 
- > Yes, please, you can place them in this bin. You need to empty your pockets and put those items in the bin as well. Do you have any liquids in your bag? 
- I do. I have a water bottle and some hand `lotion`(n. 洁肤液，护肤液，润肤乳). 
- > you'll need to take those out.
- The water bottle is too big, you can either drink it right now or throw it away.
- > I'll just throw it out.
- The hand lotion is fine because it's in a small container. you need to put it in a plastic bag though.
- > Do you have a bag that I could use? I have never flown before, and I didn't bring one.
- Sure. We have extra bags right here.
- > Thank u.
- Do you have a laptop in your bag?
- > I do.
- I'll need you to remove it as well and place it in a bin
- > please put your bag on the `conveyor belt`(conveyor /kənˈveɪər/ n. 传送带，传送装置；传播者，传达者).
- Now please step through the scanner.
- > What's wrong?
- please `step to the side`(step to a place that is on one side: away from other people).
- > Stretch out your arms, I'm going to scan your body.
- are you wearing any jewelry ? 
- > Oh yeah, I think my necklace triggered the alarm. Sorry about that.
- Allright. `U r all clear`(everything is okay).
- > you can pick up your items from the scanner and you can `head to`(go in a particular direction) your gate. Have a great flight!
- Thanks.
- United Airlines flight 803 to London is now boarding(the flight is boarding= it's time for passengers to enter the plane).  Please have your `boarding pass`(a card that permits you to enter the airplane) and identification ready for boarding.
